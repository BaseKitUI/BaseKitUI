## Playing the long game

The purpose of this project is to track and utilise modern web standards as they become available. Rather than building custom UI now and refactoring later, this project will wait to implement certain UI components until the web platform provides necessary HTML and CSS features.

- __Checkbox__: wait for `appearance: base`
- __Radio__: wait for `appearance: base`
- __Color input__: wait for `appearance: base`
- __Carousel__: wait to see what happens with Chrome’s attempt to standardise carousels
- __Tooltip__: wait for `::tooltip` pseudo-element and/or `interestfor` standardization
- __Menu__: wait for possible menu standardization
- __Switch__: wait to see if Safari’s `switch` attribute is adopted by other browsers
- __Toggle button__: wait for possible standardisation
- __Select__: wait until all browsers are supportive of custom select
- __Number input__: wait for possible increment/decrement invokers
