# BaseKitUI
A modern HTML + CSS foundation

BaseKitUI is a forward-looking project that aims to build a fully-styled set of HTML components using the very latest features in CSS and HTML. This project will grow and improve as the native features of HTML and CSS improve. This is an early stage beta project that is not currently aiming for full browser support. So long as a feature has landed in one browser and is not opposed by any other browser, I'll consider using it. 

It consists of copy-pasteable HTML and CSS "components".

## The technical principles of this project

- Uses vanilla CSS (not Sass or CSS-in-JS)
- Is designed to be copy-pasted, not installed
- Aims for simplicity
- The documentation website is built using Astro
- Avoids arcane naming conventions
- Uses the most minimal amount of JavaScript possible. When JavaScript is strictly necessary, uses vanilla JavaScript with no dependencies.
- For colors, uses OKLCH, defined as CSS custom properties.
- For performance reasons uses system fonts via system-ui.
- 0 dependencies
- Is designed to be compatible with, but not dependent on, Tailwind.

## Visual design

The visual design takes inspiration from Shadcn, Tailwind UI, and the design of GitHub.com.
